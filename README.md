# example-intents

![A text field using this plug-in](extras/preview.jpg)

## Description

This field plug-in is meant to provide a generic way to test/debug intents in Android Collect.

*Note: this is not intended to be used to collect actual data. It is intended for demonstration/testing purposes.*

## How to use

1. Download the test form [extras/test-form](extras/test-form) from this repo and upload it to your SurveyCTO server.
1. Download the [example-intents.fieldplugin.zip](example-intents.fieldplugin.zip) file from this repo, and attach it to the test form on your SurveyCTO server.

## Required parameters

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `itentName` | The name of the intent to be called (example: `android.intent.action.SENDTO`) |
| `intentParams` | The parameters expected by that intent in a JSON string format (example: `{"param1":"123","param2":"456"}`) |

*Note: in the example test form, both itentName and intentParams are stored in separate fields. The parameters passed to this field plug-in are just references to those other fields. This makes it easier during testing since the values that you are trying are saved and stored in the form data.*
